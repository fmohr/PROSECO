/**
 * This package contains Interview and related classes.
 * Interview is the medium that PROSECO uses to gather information from the user.
 * It contains a list of questions and their answers. Questions are showed to the user as HTML elements.
 * Interview is defined as a set of states (just like an automaton), so answering the questions in a state leads to a state increment.
